/*
 * xprs — the XPRS wire format (aurora docs/XPRS.md), C mirror of
 * lib/services/xprs/{xprs_packet,xprs_id,xprs_vocab}.dart.
 *
 * One line of text under 250 bytes, `key:value` fields separated by single
 * spaces, `t:` first, `m:` last (its value swallows the rest of the packet):
 *
 *   t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:net starts in ten minutes
 *
 * Everything here is pure logic over caller-owned buffers — no radio, no
 * storage, no ESP-IDF except the sha256 hook (xprs_sha256_idf.c on target,
 * supplied by the harness on host). test_xprs_host.c replays the same corpus
 * as test/xprs_packet_test.dart (test/xprs_corpus.json), so the two parsers
 * and both identifier derivations cannot drift apart unnoticed.
 *
 * Parsing is ZERO-COPY: fields point into the caller's buffer, values are not
 * NUL-terminated (they carry lengths). Field order is preserved because the
 * identifier is a hash of the packet as written — nothing here sorts,
 * normalises or rewrites.
