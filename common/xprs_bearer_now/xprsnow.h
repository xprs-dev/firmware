/**
 * @file xprsnow.h
 * @brief XPRS over ESP-NOW — every ESP32 already has this radio.
 *
 * ESP-NOW is Espressif's connectionless mode: 802.11 action frames, no
 * association, no AP, no DHCP. A frame carries **250 bytes**
 * (`ESP_NOW_MAX_DATA_LEN`), which is exactly the longest XPRS packet
 * (`docs/XPRS.md` §4) — so one packet is one frame, verbatim, and nothing is
 * ever fragmented. `link:espnow` is an assigned bearer word (§10.6.1) and
 * `docs/espnow.md` is this bearer's page.
 *
 * ── Why this is not a hotspot ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nobody connects. A SoftAP has a client ceiling and shares one channel's
 * bandwidth between everyone associated to it; ESP-NOW broadcast has neither
 * problem, because there is no association to run out of. The peer table needs
 * exactly ONE entry — the broadcast address — so `ESP_NOW_MAX_TOTAL_PEER_NUM`
 * (20) never binds however many stations are listening.
 *
 * Promiscuous mode is not used and is not needed: broadcast frames reach every
 * ESP-NOW device on the channel through the ordinary receive path, and the RSSI
 * that sniffing would have been for arrives with them (`rx_ctrl`).
 *
 * ── The one real constraint ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **ESP-NOW rides the channel the WiFi station is already on.** Two devices on
 * different channels do not hear each other and nothing reports an error —
 * `esp_now_send` succeeds, and the only symptom is a peer count that stays at
 * zero. When the station is associated to an access point, that is the AP's
 * channel; when it is not, it is whatever channel was last set.
 *
 * Moving a pair to a channel of their own, and to the long-range PHY, is
 * §23.7's `t:channel` invitation, and is not this file's job.
 *
 * ── Where the work happens ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ESP-NOW delivers into a callback that runs **in the WiFi task, on core 0** —
 * beside the radios, on the processor `docs/esp32.md` spends its length
 * defending. Deriving a §5 identifier is a SHA-256 and must not happen there.
 * So the callback copies the frame into a queue and returns; everything else
 * runs on the bearer task through `xprs_bearer`'s drain hook.

 * Frames the receive callback may hold before the bearer task drains them.
 *
 * Four was not enough. The drain shares a task with the LAN bearer's 100 ms
 * socket timeout, a SHA-256 per packet, signature checks, and SD writes behind
 * a lock the index writer holds across two fsyncs — a stall of several hundred
 * milliseconds is ordinary, and everything arriving during one was lost while
 * nothing on the dongle printed the counter.
 *
 * Sixteen was too many, and expensively so. This queue is heap, 264 bytes an
 * entry, on a board that finishes booting with about eight kilobytes free — so
 * the four kilobytes spent here came out of the allocation esp_now_send() needs,
 * and the bearer answered ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_NO_MEM to every transmission while the
 * drop counter it was widened to protect sat at zero throughout. Eight is twice
 * the original and costs half as much.
