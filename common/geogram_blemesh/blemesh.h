/*
 * blemesh — BLE street-mesh core (aurora docs/mesh.md), phone-wire-compatible.
 *
 * Three pieces, all pure logic (no radio/storage/UI — the firmware wires those):
 *
 *  1. Route-beacon codec (BLE5 manufacturer subtype 0x4D under marker 0x3E):
 *       [ver=1][class][cond][cs_len][callsign][K][(hash3+cost1)*K][bloom_len][bloom]
 *     Cond byte: bit0 powered, bits1-3 uptime bucket (log ladder), bits4-5
 *     mobility (0 unknown, 1 stationary, 2 moving), bits6-7 storage headroom.
 *     Class byte: 0 other, 1 phone, 2 tablet, 3 computer, 4 router, 5 esp32,
 *     6 base station. Routing hash = first 3 bytes of SHA-256(UPPER(callsign)).
 *
 *  2. Neighbor + distance-vector table: ingest received beacons, learn
 *     dest -> (via, cost) with cost cap 6, bidirectional confirmation (a
 *     neighbor is a usable next-hop only when its own digest lists US at
 *     cost 1), aging, and DV export for our own beacon.
 *
 *  3. Store-and-forward (SCF): park heard 1:1 frames keyed by their am: token,
 *     purge on an overheard "?ACK <am>" receipt, and hand frames back for
 *     re-air when the target reappears. Optional file persistence (stdio path,
 *     e.g. on the SD card) so parked mail survives a reboot.
