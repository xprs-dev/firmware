/**
 * @file xprslan.h
 * @brief XPRS over the local network — broadcast to everyone on the wire.
 *
 * A fourth bearer beside Bluetooth and the radios. The station puts XPRS
 * packets on the LAN as UDP broadcasts and listens for everybody else's, so a
 * desktop on the same WiFi is reachable without the packet leaving the
 * building. `docs/XPRS.md` already assigns it: `link:lan` is a bearer (§10.6)
 * and `scope:local` explicitly permits "the network it is attached to"
 * (§13.11.1). `docs/lan.md` is this bearer's page.
 *
 * ── What this is not ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not Reticulum and not the internet. No links, no identities, no routing, no
 * gateway. `xprs_lanwatch` listens to Reticulum's LAN discovery on UDP 42671
 * and is untouched by this; that is a different socket and a different protocol
 * that happens to travel on the same wire.
 *
 * ── The wire ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One XPRS packet per datagram, verbatim, with no header of our own — the
 * packet is what was composed and signed and it arrives that way. A datagram is
 * XPRS if xprs_looks_like() and xprs_parse() accept it and is dropped
 * otherwise, so there is nothing to version and any future station joins by
 * opening a socket.
 *
 * ── Re-airing without everyone shouting at once ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every station on the LAN hears the same packet and would relay it in the same
 * instant. So a bridged packet is never aired straight away: it waits a random
 * XPRSLAN_JITTER_MIN_MS..XPRSLAN_JITTER_MAX_MS, and if its identifier is heard
 * again from anybody while it waits, our copy is dropped — somebody else got
 * there first. That works because a §5 identifier is computed with `sig:` and
 * `via:` removed, so the same packet relayed by a different station carries the
 * same identifier.
