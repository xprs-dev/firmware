/**
 * @file xprsbearer.h
 * @brief What every XPRS bearer does, minus the radio.
 *
 * A bearer is a way of putting a 250-byte packet in front of whoever is
 * listening. The differences between them are small — a socket, a advertising
 * set, an ESP-NOW frame — and the part that is hard is identical: when to
 * re-air somebody else's packet, when to shut up because they got there first,
 * which identifiers have been seen, and when to beacon.
 *
 * That part was written twice before this file existed — once in
 * `xprs_bearer_lan` and once inline in the dongle's BLE relay, with the same
 * 200–1200 ms jitter and the same eight slots — and a third copy was about to
 * be written for ESP-NOW. This is that logic, once, with the radio behind five
 * function pointers.
 *
 * ── What a bearer supplies ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `air` puts bytes on the medium. `now_ms` and `random` are the clock and the
 * jitter. `lock`/`unlock` serialise transmission, because on a real station
 * several tasks air on one bearer: its own beacons, a reply from whichever task
 * heard the ask, and this file's re-air queue.
 *
 * ── What it does NOT decide ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Whether a packet may be relayed at all belongs to `xprs_codec`
 * (`xprs_append_via`, §13.1 hop budgets and §13.2 loop prevention). This file
 * asks and obeys; it never second-guesses.
 *
 * No ESP-IDF here, deliberately: the whole file compiles on a host, which is
 * where the timing and the cancel rule are actually tested.
