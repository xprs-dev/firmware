/**
 * @file xprsindex.h
 * @brief Every XPRS packet this station hears, kept on microSD and answerable.
 *
 * docs/XPRS.md section 36: an indexer is handed the packet itself, verbatim and
 * signed, and answers questions about it. This is that store for the T-Dongle.
 *
 * ── Why not msgstore, and why not SQLite ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `geogram_msgstore` has the segment discipline this borrows — append-only
 * records in seg_<first>.bin, a monotonic index, an epoch letter so a client
 * detects a wiped card and re-syncs, eviction by deleting the oldest segment.
 * That part is proven and is copied deliberately. What does not fit is its
 * RECORD: an APRS shape (from/to/text, kind derived from the APRS `to`) whose
 * 156-byte text field cannot hold a 250-byte XPRS packet at all, and whose
 * clients depend on the layout. So the iGate keeps its store and this is a
 * second one, in its own directory, with its own index and epoch.
 *
 * SQLite was the first choice and does not fit the hardware: the app binary is
 * 1,848,576 B in a 1,966,080 B partition (6% headroom) and this build has no
 * PSRAM, so a page cache would come out of the SRAM already shared with BLE,
 * WiFi and LVGL. Instead there are two small indexes, below, that answer the
 * questions actually asked in time proportional to the ANSWER rather than to
 * the store.
 *
 * ── What makes the two hard questions fast ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "The most recent warnings" — a tail index per type, `t/<code>.idx`, holding
 * 4-byte record numbers with the newest last. Twenty warnings is a seek to the
 * end, an 80-byte read and twenty direct record reads. It never grows with the
 * size of the store.
 *
 * "What was sent last year" — a zone map, `zone.idx`, one 16-byte entry per
 * segment: {first_index, min_ts, max_ts, type_mask}. Segments are written in
 * time order, so a range binary-searches the file by seeking rather than
 * loading it, and then opens only the segments whose window overlaps. The
 * type_mask lets a typed range skip a segment holding none of that type.
 *
 * Both are DERIVED. If either is missing or was truncated by a power cut it is
 * rebuilt by walking the segments; the segments are the source of truth and the
 * store is readable without either index.
 *
 * ── What may be served ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The station hears everyone, so section 36 draws a line this file enforces:
 *
 *   - no `d:`, and a publication type -> queryable by anybody
 *   - carries `d:` -> MAIL. Stored, held for that station, and never emitted to
 *     a third party. Storing a stranger's sealed message is fine (section 9.2
 *     seals the body); handing it to whoever asks is not.
 *   - ping/pong -> not stored at all; a stale liveness probe answers a question
 *     nobody is still asking.
